CS 01:198:214 Systems Project 3: Using pthread and fork() to parallel linear search an array

This project introduces the concept of multiprocessing and multithreading and aims to investigate:
- is linear searching an array with multiple threads or processes faster than just a single thread or process?
- are threads faster than processes
- what is the average amount of wall clock time spent waiting for a context switch between a thread or process
